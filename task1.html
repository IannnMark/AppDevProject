            The history of the mobile app begins, obviously, with the history
            of the mobile device and the first mobile phones whose
            microchips required the basic of software to send and receive
            calls. But since then things have got a lot more complicated.

            and
            personal digital assistants (PDAs) in the late 1980s and 1990s. EPOC stands for "Electronic Piece Of

            Wireless Markup Language (WML) was a markup language used to create content for wireless devices,
            particularly
            mobile
            phones, in the early days of mobile internet. It was designed as a simplified version of HTML to accommodate
            the
            limitations and constraints of mobile devices and their slow data connections. WML was widely used in the
            late
            1990s and
            early 2000s to create mobile-friendly websites and services.

            that
            allowed developers to create applications for mobile devices and embedded systems using the Java programming
            language.
            J2ME was designed to provide a standardized environment for developing Java applications that could run on a
            wide range
            of devices with varying capabilities, such as mobile phones, PDAs, set-top boxes, and more.
